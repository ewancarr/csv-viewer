csv-viewer
==========

csv-viewer is a viewer for tabular data files. Column separators (comma,
semicolon, tab, etc.) are auto-recognized as well as whether the table
has a header row or not. Data is loaded in background with idle-priority
allowing a quick look at a large file while (hopefully) providing a
responsive user interface.

csv-viewer requires Python 3.0 or greater [1] and PyGObject 3.0.0
or greater [2].
